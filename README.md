# Hydraulics & Gaskets Business Website

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the site.
- **CSS**: For styling the site and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Currently being implemented to add more responsive features and interactivity to the site.

## Current Progress

- The website is live and has been regularly updated to improve its functionality.
- I'm working on adding more responsive features to enhance the user experience across various devices.
- New pages are being added to offer more functionality and options for visitors, including better navigation and detailed business information.

## Future Goals

- Continue adding interactive elements and improve mobile responsiveness.
- Expand the site with additional content, including more pages that highlight different aspects of the business.
- Implement more advanced features to increase user engagement and accessibility.
